OpenAI's text generation models (often referred to as generative pre-trained transformers or "GPT" models for short), like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, have been trained to understand natural and formal language. Models like GPT-4 allows text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to these models are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you "program" a model like GPT-4, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task. Models like GPT-4 can be used across a great variety of tasks including content or code generation, summarization, conversation, creative writing, and more.
